This module implements the Projected Gradient Descent attack `ProjectedGradientDescent` as an iterative method in which,
after each iteration, the perturbation is projected on an lp-ball of specified radius (in addition to clipping the
values of the adversarial sample so that it lies in the permitted data range). This is the attack proposed by Madry et
al. for adversarial training.
